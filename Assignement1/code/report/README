All the steps are done loading the module openmpi/4.0.3/gnu/9.3.0

To compile the serial version I used
gcc -o pi.x pi.c

To compile the parallel version I used
mpicc -o mpi_pi.x mpi_pi.c

To run the paralle version I used inside the scripts
mpirun  --mca btl '^openib' -np <procs> mpi_pi.x

The sources were not modified at all since I began the run after the first version of the assignment in which any modification was forbidden.
